# Natural Time
Natural time is an ongoing attempt to re-frame the way I think about time,
and to better connect the passage of time with the motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars,
from which it was originally derived.

## Background
Prior to the advent of accurate timepieces, the time of day was determined according to the position of the Sun. As the
Earth moves around the Sun, the length of each day changes; due to the Earth's angle and elliptical orbit, the rate of
change of the day length over the course of the year is non-uniform.

Civil time, which is what we are familiar with, relies on an approximation of the Sun taken to have uniform motion over
the course of the year. As a result, civil time and true solar time rarely agree, with the difference being given by the
[Equation of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time).

The civil time that we are used to uses units of fixed length -- an hour is the same amount of time in summer as in
winter -- but this was not universal among historical time systems. Often, the day and night would each be allocated a
fixed number of hours, the length of which would vary depending on the amount of daylight at that time of year.
