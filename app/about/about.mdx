# Natural Time
Natural time is an ongoing attempt to re-frame the way I think about time, and to better connect the passage of time
with the motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars, from which it was originally derived.

## Background
Prior to the advent of accurate timepieces, the time of day was determined according to the position of the Sun.
Midday is defined as the point when the Sun reaches the highest point of its arc from East to West.{a1}
From there, the 360&deg; of rotation is divided into twenty-four 15&deg; increments corresponding with
the hours of the day; 11:00 am is the time at which the Sun is 15&deg; East of its position at midday.
In this way, the time of day is determined by the position of the Sun, rather than the time of day existing unto itself
and the motion of the Sun being projected onto that scale. Under a solar time system, it is redundant to ask 'Where will
the Sun be at 11:00 am?'--or at any other time--becuase the time of 11:00 am is *defined by* the Sun reaching the
position assigned to 11:00 am.

## Atomic measurements
Today, the second is an SI unit defined according to the observed oscillation frequency of a Cesium atom.{a2} From these
observations we derive International Atomic Time (TAI), a coordinated time standard denoting the observed passage of
time on Earth.{a3} Over time TAI drifts from observed solar time,{a4} so there is a different coordinated time standard
which underpins modern life, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC is derived by taking TAI and offsetting it by an
integer number of leap seconds to keep it from drifting too far from observed solar noon at 0&deg; latitude (the prime
meridian).

You would be forgiven for thinking that UTC, given the precision with which it is maintained, always provides an
accurate representation of the time of day.  For reasons we will get to, this is actually quite far from the truth!
But first, a further digression on how we have historically thought about time.

                    body='Second (SI): The second [...] is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium
                          frequency, ΔνCs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium
                          133 atom, to be 9,192,631,770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s−1.'

export const a3 = <Annotation trigger='3' body={<Text>
                        More correctly, time on the <em>geoid</em>, a gravitationally equipotential surface representing
                        sea level at any given point. Otherwise, time dilation would skew measurements taken in different
                        places.
                    </Text>}/>
export const a4 = <Annotation trigger='4'
                    body='This is primarily a result of the slowing rotation of the Earth due to tidal forces.'/>

## Historical Time Systems
As the Earth moves around the Sun, the amount of daylight varies throughout the year due to the tilt of Earth's axis.
The rate of change of daylight hours is non-uniform over the year,{a5} changing the most from day-to-day at the Spring
and Fall equinoxes and the least at the Summer and Winter solstices.{a6}

Civil time, which is the time system that we are familiar with, uses units of fixed length--an hour is the same amount
of time in Summer as in Winter--but this was not universal among historical time systems. Often, the day and night
would each be allocated a fixed number of hours, the length of which would vary depending on the amount of daylight at
that time of year. In addition, a 'day' was generally figured from one midday to the next, rather than our current
system of midnight to midnight.

You may notice that a trend is emerging of things being defined in terms of solar noon. Why might that be? Why is noon
more special than any of the other 23 hours of the day? And here we arrive at the first hint at the lie that is civil
time: **a day is not uniformly 24 hours long**. While we think of a day as 'one revolution of the Earth', the Earth is
moving through its orbit at the same time it is rotating. So, when it has rotated a full 360&deg;, it has also advanced
a bit and the observed Sun will be a bit East of where it was at the same 'time' yesterday; the Earth needs to rotate
360&deg; *and then a bit more* in order for the Sun to return to its zenith and reach solar noon.

In fact, the length of time from one observed solar noon to the next varies about 24 hours{a7} by as much as 30 seconds
longer to 20 seconds shorter over the course of the year. You may be wondering, how on Earth{a8} did we sweep that
under the rug of our civil time system to the point that the average person has no clue about it?

                    body="Due to a combination of the obliquity of the ecliptic and the eccentricity of Earth's orbit."

## Mechanization and the Mean Sun

The deeper you dig into the celestial movements that actually create our experience of time, the messier things get.
Our neat, tidy civil time system is a tablecloth thrown over the vagaries of the physical world, and the lynchpin of the
illusion is the **Mean Sun**. Rather than attempt to model the irregular motion of the Sun,{a9} civil time models
an abstraction which is smipler and more predictable. The Mean Sun is a virtual Sun taken to have the same orbital
period as the apparent Sun,{a10} but with an orbital velocity equal to the yearly average velocity of the apparent
Sun.{a11} Therefore, the daily Eastward motion of the Mean Sun does not vary, and the length of a mean solar day is a
constant 24 hours all through the year.

The discrepancy between a varying and constant orbital velocity causes the apparent Sun to lag and lead the Mean Sun
in turns over the course of a year, and civil noon may differ from solar noon by ~15 minutes in either direction
at various points of the year. To account for this we turn to the
<Link href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time'>Equation of Time</Link>, which is a periodic function
describing this difference with respect to the day of the year.

This may seem strange and convoluted--and it is!--but there is a good reason why our time system relies on an idealized
abstraction of the Sun. To wit, accurately representing apparent solar time using eighteenth-century technology 
required additional components and increased manufacturing complexity.{a12} The relative simplicity of modeling mean
solar time gave it an edge as precision clock and watches became widely adopted, leading to the ubiquity of our
current system.

## What time is it?

So, you may be asking, what's the point of all this? Why does it matter that we use mean time instead of apparent time?
What difference does it make that we model each day as being the same length?

Have you ever said 'Good morning!' to someone, only to think 'Actually I guess it's not morning anymore, it's
afternoon.' But it just really didn't *feel* like afternoon? Well, that's because **it probably wasn't**. Take
the Equation of Time, sprinkle in Daylight Savings and longitudinal deviation from the standard time of your Time Zone,
and apparent solar noon can be as late as **1:30 PM**. We've been using exclusively mean civil time since we learned
to read clocks, and yet we are so attuned to the motion of the Sun that we get mixed up when civil time disagrees with
apparent solar time.

We are wired to connect with the motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars, as we have been doing for millenia, but our modern
time system severs this connection. We are used to thinking in civil time, and imposing it on celestial motion. But
celestial motion *is* time. The Mean Sun approximation is a relic of the technological path we took to get here, but
we have surpassed that model and can define elapsed time precisely using only atomic observation.

My aim with this project is to re-examine how we think about time at the human level, and whether we can devise a time
system that maintains all of the benefits we have realized in precision and coordination while getting us more in touch
with the physical reality around us.
