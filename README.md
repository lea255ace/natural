# Natural Time

Natural Time is an ongoing attempt to re-frame the way I think about time,
and to better connect the passage of time with the motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars,
from which it was originally derived.

A web-based version of this project is hosted [here](https://lea255ace.github.io/natural_time/).
A more detailed writeup is hosted on the [About page](https://lea255ace.github.io/natural_time/about).
